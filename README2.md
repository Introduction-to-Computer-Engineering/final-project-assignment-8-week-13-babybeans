### Task 1: Visualize output of built-in function generator
a) This video shows the configured the OUT of the built-in function generator on the workstation connected to the oscilloscope. https://imgur.com/gallery/mOg0nlE

b ) Here is the video of the oscilloscope attached to the function generator: https://imgur.com/gallery/nSErFpw

c) Here is the video that shows the one line of code that sends a PWM pulse: https://imgur.com/gallery/5a2Psok

d) Here is a video of that shows a program that sends PWM pusles with the period of the base wave increasing by 5% every time. https://imgur.com/gallery/1wxIQhl

### Task 6: Answer the following questions
###### What are the disadvantages of the other two serial communication channels, UART and SPI, and how does I2C improve on them?

UART is between only 2 devices that have to have the same data rate. If more than one device is connected to the same port bus contention can be a problem. It also usually requires extra hardware. SPI requires a lot of pins and can become excessive. Routing signals also become more difficult in a tight PCB layout. I2C can support more than one master, requires only two wires, and supports up to 1008 slave devices.
###### I2C is a two-wire serial communication channel. What are the two wires, SDA and SCL?
SDA is the data signal, which is the information that is being transmitted. The SCL is the clock signal that acts as a sort of timer for the exchange of data. The clock signal is generated by the master.
###### What distinguishes the master and the slaves?
Masters drives the clock and initiates the transfer over the I2C bus. Slaves can transfer data, but cannot initiate transfer. Slaves can also delay the clock by clock stretching to delay the transmission of data.
###### How are the two types of protocol frames different?
The address frame is the first process in the communication sequence. Once the first eight bits if the data is trasmitted to the recieving device, the device should pull SDA line low. The data frame is when the master generates a continuous clock signal, and the SDA is either placed on the master or slave depending on if the program call for read or write.
###### What is the most appropriate trigger for capturing an I2C frame on the oscilloscope?
The appropriate trigger for capturing an I2C frame on the oscilloscope is the falling edge of the SDA. The reason for this is that process is started off by the address frame, which pulls the SDA low. This means that the SDA will lead with a falling edge. The data frame has not yet been started at the point of the address frame, so the SCL will start after the SDA.

###### (Advanced) If the micro:bit is configured by default as a master, and two micro:bits, connected to each other via the SDA and SCL lines, communicate over I2C? (Bonus for a convincing argument, one way or another.)
Both microbits are configured to be masters by default. Unless the programmer wants to go deep into the operating system, having 2 masters will not work. Two of the reasons for this is that there would be two masters trying to initiate transmission of data and two clocks that would not be in sync.
### Task 7: Capture an I2C frame from the micro:bit
